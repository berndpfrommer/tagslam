# Example 5

- Location: PERCH/Pennovation
- Cameras:
   . 4 PointGrey 1280x1200 Python 3000 monchrome
- Calibration: equidistant (fisheye)
- Source bag: unknown
- detector: MIT
- frames: 2751
- Remark: runs a good while before the first optimization is possible.
  D does extrinsic calibration on the fly. Short focal length, lots
  of distortion.  A challenging dataset. Runs a long time (20min+), 36000 factors!
